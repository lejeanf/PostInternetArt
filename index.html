        <h3>Web:</h3>
        <p>
          <b class="coloredTxt">A constant evolution/</b></br>
          The first version of internet was developped by scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. This technology was used by the army and quickly got viral in
          the accademic world. It is only in 1991 when Internet became accessible to the public as a service. Since its inception, many evolution occured
          and as we know it, it affected the world in general but the goal of this page is to take glance on how it afected the art world.

        <h3>Web Art:</h3>
        <p>
          Art that require coding skills. An art that museums failed to integrate in gallery spaces in the first place.
          Most of the
          net.art represented in real life involved uncomfortable interactive artworks with computers, which ended up being used only to check emails
          instead of experiencing the work itself. As Olia lialina said in her essay <i>All you need is Link</i>: "Net art exhibitions are the ugliest
          phenomenon of the modern art scene."</br></br>
        </p>

        <h3>Weird in-between period:</h3>
        <p>During the early 2000s, an important variety of works laid the basis of what came to be a
          post-internet boom. Two of the most notable examples were the work of Cory Arcangel and Seth Price. While Ancangel was paving the way of a new
          conceptual way of dealing with historicity and specificity of internet as a medium inside and outsite the computer, Price writing would be proven
          a crucial theorical anchor for a new generation of artists. In his famous text <i>Dispersion</i>, he underline how artists might exist outside the
          limits of the art world. He then quote the philosopher Sarat Marajah, who sees the question as "a marker for ways we might be able to engage with
          works, events, spasms, ructions that don't look like art and don't count as art but are somehow electric, energy nodes, attractors, transmitters,
          conductors of new thinking, new subjectivity and action that visual artwork in the traditional sense is not able to articulate."</br></br>
        </p>

        <h3>Post Internet Art:</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="greenTxt"> 1</span> - <span class="quote">"The term “post-internet” was first used by Marisa Olson in 2008,
          which, although not long ago on an art historical scale, is ancient history in terms of the evolution of the internet. In retrospect,
          she was speaking when Web 2.0 was only in its incipient stages."</span> - Roman Road Journal available
          <a href="https://romanroadjournal.com/post-internet-art-the-search-for-a-definition/">here</a>
          She <span class="quote">"meant to refer to art that a) couldn’t / wouldn’t exist before the internet (technologically, phenomenologically,
          existentially) and b) was in the “style” of or “under the influence” of the internet in some way.”</span> - Marisa Olson refered to in the
          same article</br>
          <span class="greenTxt">2</span> -<span class="quote"> Art made in the wake of spending time surfing the internet.</span> - Marisa Olso
          refered In <i>Art in the age of the internet</i> - No ghost just a shell, page 15, respini.
          <span class="greenTxt">3</span> -<span class="quote"> A new poststudio paradigm appears.</span> In his essay <i>Next-level spleen</i>, John
          Kelsey recites a new and widely accepted mantra that now, "the laptop and phone have already supplanted the studio as primary site of production."
           While it is true that not everyone have access to such device, the massive proliferation of gesture from them at least affect indirectly almost
           everyone. Commercialized spaces now dominate the once utopian cyberspace, which seems already more like a distant dream than an recent historical
           event. Junkspace and junktime are creeping in from everywhere as pockets of resistance and emancipations still rise from this complex environment. Having this in mind, it is interesting to ask how artist are existing whitin huge networked structures. Joel Holmberg's <i>Legendary Account</i> is one example of this questionning, where the artist relentlessly asked many things about being an artist on Yahoo! Answers. As of today, no easy answer to the riddles posed a decade a go by "Dispersion" have been fully answered.

        <h3>The New Aesthetic:</h3>
        <p>
          The <span class="greenTxt">New Aesthetic</span> is a term, coined by <span class="greenTxt">James Bridle</span>, used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology
          and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical.
          Bridle, James. <span class="quote">“The New Aesthetic and Its Politics.”</span> <a href="Booktwo.org.com">Booktwo.org.com</a> (blog), June 12, 2013. available <a href="http://booktwo.org/notebook/new-aesthetic-politics.">here</a>.
        </p>

          <p>
            The New Aesthetic is a native product of modern network culture. An open-source, shareable concept, crowdsource, is made by many small
            pieces loosely joined. It can be work, a conversation, a performance, an experiment and more. It comments issues around
            computation, as we live in a society define and shaped by technology. Technology is political like everything else and we should be
            concerned of these, better controlling them before being controlled by them.  It is a contemporary movement according to Bruce Sterling,
            he believes that New Aesthetic is the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="quote">“There truly are many forms of imagery nowadays that are modern, and unique to this period. We’re surrounded by systems, devices and
            machineries generating heaps of raw graphic novelty. We built them, we programmed them, we set them loose for a variety of motives, but
            they do some unexpected and provocative things. Bridle’s collection of this material is huge. The evidence is impossible to refute.
            Anybody with a spark of perception who looks through [his Tumblr recognizes] that modernity reality is on display there.”</span>  P.114
        </p>

          <p>This is still evolving, we are living the moment, constantly changing, new trends, new platforms are going to be invented and we will
            embrace it in some ways for the better and the worse. The physical reality is blurred into the intangible digital realm. Plato’s Cave or
            The Matrix could be an outcome of bad use of technology.

        <h2>The notion of identity</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.iotevolutionworld.com/iot/articles/410328-step-back-time-history-evolution-digital-identity.htm">

          <!-- THERE IS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE IDENTITY ONLINE IN THIS ARTICLE LINKED ABOVE,
          FEEL FREE TO DIG IN AND REFER TO IT OR TO SOME BETTER TEXT-->
          step-back-time-history-evolution-digital-identity</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          As the accessibiliy of internet and the increasing easyness of uploading to online, the notion of Identity changed. At first websters were
          refered as <span class="greenTxt">users</span>, it was common pseudos for usernames making the identity behind the user less certain. Now, with
          social networks constantly
          trying to identify the actual <span class="greenTxt">person</span> behind the IP, the idea of online anonymity fades away although initiatives
          coming from the hacker culture
          can be found to counter-act this trend (e.g. the use of VPN's, or the tor network). Now google even refer to this online identity as a
          <span class="greenTxt">Ledger</span>,
          a knowledged passed through generations that might help understanding human behaviours on a larger scale (see
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDVVo14A_fo">this</a>
          video for more information).
       </p>
       <p>
          But how these trends affect the views and practices of today? Michael Wang argues, in a article on the Work of Ryan Trecartin, that "a
          representational order in which words, images and objects no longer inhabit separate strata of experience, but instead intermingle, hybridize
          and transform into one another". From this intensely recorded, recklessly data-ified and capitalist-post-MTV fueled milieu comes what Douglas
          Coupland have called the <i>extreme present</i>. In it's most recent     incarnation, it encompass a rapid endeavor of massively networked identity
          politics. On the internet and beyond, many practices like the one of Ann Hirsch, Martine Syms, Keith Obadike, Bunny Rogers and Amalia Ulman have
          complicated the problem of the gaze, while setting up narratives and manifestos through the lens of gender, race, nation and other sociological
          categories.

  <!-- Analyse critqique -->
  <div class="textContainer">
      <h2>Critic analysis and definition of criterias</h2>
      <h3> Criterias helping to know what is Post-Internet-Art.</h3>
      <p>
        1 - Art that either in the process or in the making uses internet content or medium.</br>
        2 - Was made after 2004 (since internet became a mass information support)</br>
        3 - Internet based practice that was exhibited in the real world.
      </p>
      <h3>Contreversy in new media art, highly present in Post-Internet-Art.</h3>
      <p>
        - A focus on the tool</br>
        - A focus on the surface aesthetics</br>
        - How not to get swalowed by the <i>techné</i> ?
      </p>
      <h3>Possible future directions:</h3>
      <p><b class="coloredTxt">Question?</b></br>
        After reading this book, I questioned myself the pertinence of doing arts regarding the real, the physical, the classic art form.
        Is the visual arts’ future heading towards exclusively into digital? Is the dead of the classic art forms such sculpture, painting, etc.
        Or is this the ultimate art form.</br>
        As an artist, I am aware of my ecological footprint that I leave each time that I am producing artworks. Someday, polluting is no longer
        permitted or very restricted. Either way, the artwork ends up by being digitalized thought photography or film into the digital platform
        (Social media, website, app or new innovate platform never heard before). All the process leads to this end which is inevitable. To document
        and preserve the existence of the work, going digital, is the reality and the affordable one. The old projector slides aren’t as available as
        the 70’s or 80’s, the VHS still is available but isn’t as efficient as the cloud. You name it, nothing beats the internet. Best or better, it
        is the most important invention after the print.</br>
        <i>While talking with Jean-Francois and John around the subject, I came into realization that when I photograph my artwork, there is the first
        picture, the selling point of view of the artwork. Like the CV, this point of view must convince the jury of the exhibition that the works
        fits or not.</i>
