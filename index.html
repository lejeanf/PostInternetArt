      <h2>Origin of web-art practice through the evolution of internet</h2>
      <p><img width="100%" src="animatedNoise.gif"/><span  class="coloredTxt">Web:</span> a constant evolution</p>
      <p><span class="quote">"Social media is to the read/write web that sprawl is to the metropolis of modernity, a homogenous, cancerous, rhizomatic
        junkspace that expands exponentially outward on a sludgy wave of strip malls and sponsored links, greed and induced demand"</span> -

        <b class="coloredTxt">Web Art:</b> Art that require coding skills. An art that museums failed to integrate in gallery spaces in the first place. Most of the net.art represented in real life involved uncomfortable interactive artworks with computers, which ended up being used only to check emails instead of experiencing the work itself. As Olia lialina said in her essay <i>All you need is Link</i>: "Net art exhibitions are the ugliest phenomenon of the modern art scene."</br></br>
        <b class="coloredTxt">Weird in-between period:</b> During the early 2000s, an important variety of works laid the basis of what came to be a post-internet boom. Two of the most notable examples were the work of Cory Arcangel and Seth Price. While Ancangel was paving the way of a new conceptual way of dealing with historicity and specificity of internet as a medium inside and outsite the computer, Price writing would be proven a crucial theorical anchor for a new generation of artists. In his famous text <i>Dispersion</i>, he underline how artists might exist outside the limits of the art world. He then quote the philosopher Sarat Marajah, who sees the question as "a marker for ways we might be able to engage with works, events, spasms, ructions that don't look like art and don't count as art but are somehow electric, energy nodes, attractors, transmitters, conductors of new thinking, new subjectivity and action that visual artwork in the traditional sense is not able to articulate."</br></br>

          Marisa Olson in 2008,
          which, although not long ago on an art historical scale, is ancient history in terms of the evolution of the internet. In retrospect,
          she was speaking when Web 2.0 was only in its incipient stages."</span> - Roman Road Journal available

      <h2>The notion of identity</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.iotevolutionworld.com/iot/articles/410328-step-back-time-history-evolution-digital-identity.htm">

      <p>As the accessibiliy of internet and the increasing easyness of uploading to online, the notion of Identity changed. At first websters were
      refered as <span class="greenTxt">users</span>, it was common pseudos for usernames making the identity behind the user less certain. Now, with
      social networks constantly
      trying to identify the actual <span class="greenTxt">person</span> behind the IP, the idea of online anonymity fades away although initiatives
      coming from the hacker culture
      can be found to counter-act this trend (e.g. the use of VPN's, or the tor network). Now google even refer to this online identity as a
      <span class="greenTxt">Ledger</span>,
      a knowledged passed through generations that might help understanding human behaviours on a larger scale (see
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDVVo14A_fo">this</a>
       video for more information).
